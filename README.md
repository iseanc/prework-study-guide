## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This project is intended to familiarize new bootcamp students with the basic software development process through a PREWORK module covering basic concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming.

In particular, the project provided a good introduction to Git and GitHub workflow and command-line usage by repeating the same branch checkout and create, modify, add, commit, push, pull request and review.
